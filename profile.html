                            I'm a passionate computer programming student with a focus on web development and artificial intelligence. 
                            Currently in 11th grade at San Beda College Alabang, I enjoy building beautiful and functional applications that solve real-world problems. 
                            When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with new technologies.
